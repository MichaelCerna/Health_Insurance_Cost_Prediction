# Health_Insurance_Cost_Prediction
This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project focused on predicting health insurance costs. 

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project focused on predicting health insurance costs. Health insurance cost prediction is a critical task in the healthcare industry and can help individuals, insurance providers, and policymakers make informed decisions.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts health insurance costs based on various features such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and more. The project aims to provide insights into the factors that contribute to insurance costs and facilitate cost estimation for individuals and insurance companies.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploring data to gain insights into the relationships between variables.
- **Feature Importance**: Identifying the three most important features: "If they are a smoker," "Age," and "BMI."
- **Normality Assessment**: Demonstrating data non-normality using Shapiro-Wilk test and QQ plot.
- **Kernel Density Estimation**: Implementing Kernel Density Estimation with a Gaussian kernel to visualize the density clusters for charges with "Smoker" and "BMI" as features.
- **Regression Modeling**: Building and evaluating regression models to predict insurance costs.
- **Random Forest Regressor**: Achieving a baseline RMSE of approximately 4675 and an R-squared of 0.86.
- **Anomaly Removal**: Performing minor anomaly removals.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters for improved performance.
- **Cross-Validation**: Implementing 5-fold cross-validation, resulting in an RMSE of 4340 and an R-squared of approximately 0.86.


- This project was developed as part of a machine learning course.
- The dataset used in this project is publicly available on [source link].
